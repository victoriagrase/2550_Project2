# A Comprehensive Regression Analysis Approach into Investigating Predictive Models for Tracheostomy Outcomes

## Abstract
This study endeavors to construct predictive models for the composite outcome of tracheostomy, with a specific emphasis on guiding indication criteria and optimal timing for tracheostomy placement. Leveraging various regression analysis techniques, including Lasso regression, logistic regression, and backward stepwise regression, the research aims to understand the intricate relationships among different variables influencing tracheostomy occurrences. Initial exploration of bivariate and univariate relationships reveals a class imbalance, prompting a meticulous approach to model development. The analysis encompasses a diverse dataset, encompassing patient demographics, clinical indicators, and relevant medical history. Lasso regression, renowned for its feature selection capability, is employed to identify the most influential predictors associated with tracheostomy. Logistic regression further refines the model by calculating the probability of tracheostomy occurrence based on the identified predictors. Addressing challenges posed by missing data, multiple imputation techniques are implemented to effectively handle incomplete information. This involves creating imputed datasets, conducting analyses on each, and comparing results to provide a comprehensive and robust prediction model. The developed models aim results (PUT REUSLTS HERE)
